# QWalks Software
# Description

*Qwalks* software implements the discrete time quantum walks models
which are spatially dependent. It provides general functionalities
of statistical measures and dynamics of quantum walks. This is the first
of its kind project that deals with Anderson Localization in a spatially dependent 
disorders which were based on the following publications.

- S Boettcher. *Quantum Ultra Walks: Walks on a line with hierarchical spatial heterogeneity*. 2020. DOI:10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.023411

- Flach et.al. *Anderson localization in generalized discrete-time quantum walks*. 2017.  
     DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.96.144204

Currently the software offers the implementation of 

- `QWdisorders` which supports both spatially independent and dependent disorders and showcases the results for localization,sub-ballistic spread, and divergent walks. 
- `QWevolve` supports the static snapshots at any time-step and can be used in the creation of gif(s) for the time-evolution of our Quantum Walks such as the following for hadamard walks, and spatially variant hierachical walks which see different probability amplitudes due to hierarchy.

# Exemplary Usage 

This software was used in the completion of Masters thesis and 
subsequent publication on the topic of localization in spatial 
dependent quantum walks.
